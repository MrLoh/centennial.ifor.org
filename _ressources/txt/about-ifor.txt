The International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR) was founded in 1914 in response to the horrors of war in Europe. IFOR has taken a consistent stance against war and its preparation throughout its history. Perceiving the need for healing and reconciliation in the world, the founders of IFOR formulated a vision of the human community based upon the belief that love in action has the power to transform unjust political, social, and economic structures.
