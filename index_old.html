				<p>
					The commandment of love is shared by all great spiritual traditions. IFOR welcomes everyone who seeks to promote peace and reconciliation, truth, mercy and justice in all dimensions of life.
				</p>
				<p>
					The members of IFOR are committed to active nonviolence, which includes resistance to injustice, respect of the enemy, acceptance of diversity and dialogue. They are convinced that nonviolence is the way to transformation on personal, social, economic and political levels and thus is hope for the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reflecting on the violence of the past and addressing the challenges of today, approximately 150 delegates from IFOR member organizations across the globe will gather in Konstanz, Germany 100 years after the outbreak of World War I. World- renowned nonviolence experts, representatives from like-minded peace organizations, and members of the general public will join IFOR in mourning, celebration, and envisioning the future.
